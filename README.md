# MDverse database

# 1) Environment setup with UV

For this project, we will be using **UV** to create and manage our environments.

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## A) Clone the git repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:MDverse/md_data_schema.git
cd md_data_schema
```

---

## B) Sync dependencies

Once inside the repository, sync the environment with:
```sh
uv sync
```

This will install all necessary dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

# 2) Creating the database

After setting up your environment with `uv`, you can create the databse using:

```sh
uv run -m src.app
```

### Why `uv run -m src.app` and not `python -m src.app`?

Because this is a larger project with a **Python package** and not a single Python file, we **cannot** call it just by passing a single file name like in the example below:
```sh
uv run src/app.py
```
Instead, we have to tell Python that we want it to execute a **module** that is part of a package:
```sh
uv run -m src.app
```
The `-m` flag tells Python to call a **module** inside a package.
This ensures Python correctly resolves dependencies and imports.

Using `uv run` instead of `python` ensures that the command runs within the **UV-managed environment**, preventing conflicts with global Python installations and ensuring dependency consistency.


# 3) Visualizing the database

To explore the database visually, you can use **SQLite Browser**. Run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sqlitebrowser
```

Then, select **"Open Database"** (equivalent to *Ouvrir une base de donn√©es* in French) and choose `database.db` to browse its contents.
